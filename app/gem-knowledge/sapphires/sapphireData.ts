    introContent:
        "Sapphires, renowned for their stunning colors and exceptional durability, are among the most cherished gemstones in the world. As a gem-quality member of the corundum family, sapphires are the September birthstone and rank second only to diamonds in hardness. While blue sapphires are the most iconic, these gems come in every color of the rainbow except red (red corundum is classified as ruby). At Donai Gems, we offer a curated selection of sapphires, showcasing their versatility and elegance for jewelry enthusiasts and collectors.",

                'Sapphires are corundum gemstones (aluminum oxide, Al₂O₃) colored by trace elements: Blue sapphires get their color from iron and titanium. Pink, yellow, green, and other colors come from chromium, iron, or other elements. Color-change sapphires contain vanadium, causing a shift in color under different lighting (e.g., violet-blue in daylight, deep purple in incandescent light). Padparadscha sapphires feature a rare blend of chromium and iron creating the coveted pinkish-orange to orange-pink hue. All red corundum is classified as ruby, while all other colors are sapphires, collectively called "fancy sapphires" when not blue.',
