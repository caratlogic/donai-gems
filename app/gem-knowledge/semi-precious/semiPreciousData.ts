        "Semi-precious gems, often more abundant and affordable than their precious counterparts (diamond, ruby, sapphire, and emerald), offer a dazzling array of colors, patterns, and properties that make them ideal for jewelry, carvings, and collectors. Traditionally, these gems are distinguished by their relative availability, but many rival precious stones in beauty and durability. At Donai Gems, we celebrate the diversity of semi-precious gems, sourcing high-quality specimens to inspire your jewelry creations and collections.",
